First of all you this is a work in progress and I'm working overtime to keep it updated. Right now I'm focusing on delivering all the features I want to showcase my work eventually I add documentation and else. If you are interested in using this code, go right ahead, I can't promise that is not going to break or have bugs. I can always help you setting up your enviroment and get it up an running.

Things I'm planning to do:

## Development server

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/). 
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.

## Deploying to Github Pages
